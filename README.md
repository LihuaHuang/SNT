# SeqNT
Sequential Network Tomography : Exploiting the Temporal Correlation in Network Monitoring
sequential network tomography infers link metrics by exploiting the temporal correlation of link state
# setup  
## Requirements:
matlab (>=R2016a)
## topology and routing matrix
1. Run `www` to generate the topology, including the adjacency matrix of the graph 
2. run `routingMatrixGenFromAdja.m` to generate the routing matrix.

# Run the SAT, SBT and other recovery methods
The run.m invoke all the recovery methods. The parameters are 
* fileName: routing matrix
* d: Number of link state transitions
* m1: number of measurements at time 1
* m2: number of measurements at time t>1
An example usage is
```matlab
run('matlab.mat',1,1200,600)
